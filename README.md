# Patterns

This Patterns library is an adaption to OpenMusic of Rick Taube's "Pattern Streams", as conceived and programmed in the Common Music application.

The classes and methods made avilable here are close to Rick's original "Item Streams" found in CM v.2.0.  
They use the same names and provide most of the functionality.  
The only change in the names is a prepended 'p-': "p-cycle", "p-markov" etc.

The library comes with simple examples and tutorial patches, available from the menu "Help->Import Tutorial Patches..." after
the library is made avilable.  
The examples are similar to CM's original documentation for the "Patterns" classes.

A great guide to composing using patterns is chapter 20 in Rick's book:  [Notes from the Metalevel](http://www.moz.ac.at/sem/lehre/lib/cm/Notes%20from%20the%20Metalevel/index.html).

Patterns are used everywhere in the book. 

The data parsing features of the original versions: 'keynum', 'transpose' etc. are not provided in this version of the lib.

Thanks to Rick Taube for conceiving these very useful classes for composition work.
