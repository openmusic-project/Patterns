# Patterns

This Patterns library is inspird by Rick Taube's "Item Streams", as originally conceived in the Common Music application.

The library includes several examples and tutorial patches, available from the menu "Help->Import Tutorial Patches...".

A great guide to composing using patterns is chapter 20 in Rick's
book: [Notes from the
Metalevel](http://www.moz.ac.at/sem/lehre/lib/cm/Notes%20from%20the%20Metalevel/index.html).
Patterns are used everywhere in that book.

Thanks to Rick Taube for laying out the initial versions of these very useful classes for composition work.

Other music & sound programming environments including variations of
the Pattern classes include SuperCollider:
