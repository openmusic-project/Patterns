# Patterns

Patterns library for OM, Anders Vinjar

This library is an adaption of Rick Taube's "Item Streams" (or "Patterns Streams") as found in Common Music.  
Variations of Rick's original "Item Streams" can be found in other composition environments, notably SuperColliders "Pattern" classes.

A good general intro to Item Streams is found in chapter 20 of Rick Taube's book "Notes from the Metalevel":
