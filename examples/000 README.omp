They use the same names and provide most of the functionality.  The only change in the names is a prepended 'p-': \"p-cycle\",\"p-markov\" etc, to not clutter OMs symbol-space.$$The library comes with simple examples and tutorial patches,available from the menu \"Help->Import Tutorial Patches...\" after the library is made avilable.  The examples are similar to CM's original documentation for the \"Patterns\" classes.$$For a more through discussion with examples take a look in Rick's book \"Notes from the Metalevel\":$$    https://books.google.no/books/about/Notes_from_the_Metalevel.html?id=88OGQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y$$Other environments i know of providing similar classes are SuperCollider and Csound.$$Thanks to Rick Taube for conceiving these very useful classes for composition work!")
